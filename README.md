# 100 Pandas Puzzles - My Solutions ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions to the **100 Pandas Puzzles**, a collection of exercises to practice Python and Pandas.

## ðŸŒŸ Why I Started This?  
As a data science learner, I wanted to improve my problem-solving skills. I often use AI and online resources to help, but I make sure to understand each problem deeply before writing the final solution.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Included?  
âœ… Solved exercises with explanations.  
âœ… My thought process for tricky questions.  
âœ… Alternative solutions (if any).  

## ðŸ“š Learning Resources  
- Pandas Documentation: [pandas.pydata.org](https://pandas.pydata.org)  
- Stack Overflow for troubleshooting  
- AI assistance to understand concepts  

## ðŸš€ Work in Progress  
So far, 60 questions are available, and I will update the repository as new ones are released.
